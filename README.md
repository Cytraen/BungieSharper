## About
**BungieSharper** is a .NET client library for the Bungie.net API.  
**BungieSharper.Entities** Is also available standalone, if you would like to use your own client.  
**BungieSharper.CodeGen** consumes [Bungie's OpenAPI spec,](https://github.com/Bungie-net/api) and turns it into code usable by BungieSharper.  

### What currently works
To my knowledge, everything **should.** Will it? Most likely.
